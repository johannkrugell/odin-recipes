      <p>Your toddlers behaviour was excellent today! What is a temper tantrum 
        anyways? Time to reward that good behaviour with a lollipop. Every toddler
        knows that a lollipop tastes better when it was licked by someone else first. 
      </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A store bought lollipop</li>
        <li>A sybling or pet</li>
        <li>Any hard surface</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the lollipop wrapper</li>
        <li>Let your pet dog or cat have a few licks</li>
        <li>If you don't have a pet try a sybling</li>
        <li>Only child? Don't worry...lick the lollipop yourself or just roll it 
          under the fridge</li>
        <li>Your done. Your toddler can now enjoy the lollipop just the way
          he likes it</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Bon Appetit!</p>
